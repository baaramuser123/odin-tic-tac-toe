Object breakdowns
Player, simple object that stores simple variables for name, score, shape.

Gameboard, also a simple object that stores the array for the grid and 
maybe a function that displays the grid

Gameflow, contains function that checks for 3 in a row
contains function that includes all the calls of other functions/objects to run game from start to finish
contains function that takes player input through prompts
creating new game with this object initiates start of game sequence

-#Player-Display- TABLE for those registered, games played, won, etc. no borders,
 max height 300px and scrollable
-#Grid Div, centered, pretty big and square. Borders are same light yellow as header,
 grid filled in by JS.
-Start Game button is GrayedOUT until two players are registered.
-All Buttons hidden on GameStart, FLOW Messages fill #Display
-On Game Conclusion, add a "Finish Game" button to refresh original screen.


Buttons Plan
-Add Players button will call up a form for Name.
-Created Players will add to a table, and a red X on right side.
-red X on right will delete player.
-When hitting Start Game, will not click until 2 players are added
-Start Game will bring up form asking you to select player 1 and 2, as well as color and shape for each, using dropdowns.
    Will also clear out the #Display div in the DOM.
-Grid becomes clickable upon game start, and each grid item should
 become unclickable after being clicked.
-Finish Game button displayed after game concludes, should Display to show original buttons and playerlist, blank out grid.
